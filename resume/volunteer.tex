        The High School Data Science Competition assigns an interesting problem to five student teams to tackle using a large data set. The teams must analyze the data in depth with the help of industry mentors and then make the best recommendation to solve the problem. The HIT in the CLE talent program was created by BioEnterprise, CoverMyMeds, and the Cleveland Foundation to help students realize the possibilities of a career in health IT and to help IT firms in Northeast Ohio construct a talent pipeline.

        Historically, transportation and planning organizations have had to rely significantly on costly and unreliable manual data collection systems to manage and evaluate their services. The volume, kind, and quality of data available to planners and managers is changing as Information and Telecommunication Technology advances. The goal of this project is to use such technologies to enable better and more full access to the public record, and to depict this data as an isochrone map.
