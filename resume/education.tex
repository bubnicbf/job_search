      Massive Stellar Clusters in the Disk of the Milky Way Galaxy
    \end{cvcompactparagraph}
    \begin{cvabstractparagraph}
      Astronomers have a lot of information on globular clusters. They're easy to spot because they're mostly outside the galaxy's plane in the halo. Extinction is rare, the star population is dense, and they are rather numerous. However, nothing is known about the open cluster population in the galaxy's plane. Open clusters in the galactic disk have been mapped in this thesis using near-infrared broad-band photometry and spectroscopy.

      A Novel Method for Low-Toxic Photo-Etch Printing
    \end{cvcompactparagraph}
    \begin{cvabstractparagraph}
      This thesis demonstrates how aquatint etching techniques, which have long been employed in intaglio printmaking, may be applied to give artists with a unique method for photo-etch procedures. The photo etching process was enhanced using scientific approaches, and then compared to copper etched in ferric chloride.
